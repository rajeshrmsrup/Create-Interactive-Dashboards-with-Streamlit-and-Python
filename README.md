# Create-Interactive-Dashboards-with-Streamlit-and-Python
Now, you are going to get comfortable with using Python and Streamlit to build beautiful and interactive data dashboards I load, explore, visualize and interact with data, and generate dashboards in less than 130 lines of Python code! I accomplished it by completing each task in the project:

#### Task 1: Project Overview and Demo
#### Task 2: Turn Simple Python Scripts into Web Apps
#### Task 3: Load the Twitter US Airline Sentiment Data
#### Task 4: Display Tweets in the Sidebar
#### Task 5: Plot Interactive Bar Plots and Pie Charts
#### Task 6: Plotting Location Data on an Interactive Map
#### Task 7: Plot Number of Tweets by Sentiment for Each Airline
#### Task 8: Word Cloud for Positive, Neutral, and Negative Tweets
